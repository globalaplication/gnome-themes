Some random general notes:


1. The icon theme sets don't get installed or work automagically yet 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm just getting all the icons into cvs so we don't lose them... we'll need some build script magic to install them all into the right place ($prefix/share/icons) at some point.

Easiest way to see them in action right now is to:

- create a ~/.icons/default directory, containing Alex's default index.theme file from freedesktop.org.  (Hint:  just copy one of the <themename>/icons/index.theme files in this module, remove the "Inherits" line, and change the name on the "Name=" line to be 'default').

$ mkdir ~/.icons/<themename>

$ cp -r <themename>/icons/* ~/.icons/<themename>/

- choose <themename> from Applications->Desktop Prefs->Theme

$ gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/interface/icon_theme "<themename>" --type=string


2. To create low contrast icons in GIMP from the original coloured icon
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Load icon file
- Open Image->Colors->Levels dialog
- Set "modify levels for channel" to "value"
- Set output levels to 125 and 175
- Save icon :)
