Some random general notes:


1. Creating a default icon theme
--------------------------------

The icon themes now install into $(prefix)/share/icons as per
Alex's icon theming spec on freedesktop.org.

However, this module doesn't install a 'default' theme, which these ones 
inherit from.  The quickest way to do this:

1. Create a ~/.icons/default directory

2. Copy one of the <themename>/icons/index.theme files from this module into 
the directory, remove the "Inherits" line, and change the name line to 
"Name=default".

2. Switching icon themes
------------------------
Unless you're running my patched theme switcher dialog (patch in bugzilla,
#93486), you'll need to switch icon themes by hand using GConf:

$ gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/interface/icon_theme "<themename>" --type=string


3. To create low contrast icons in GIMP from the original coloured icon
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the low-contrast-preset.scm GIMP script in this directory to create a low
contrast icon from a regular-coloured icon.  (Read the comments in the script
for instructions on how to install and use it.)  Thanks to Guillermo for
providing this!
