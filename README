Some random general notes:


1. Creating a default icon theme
--------------------------------

The icon themes now install into $(prefix)/share/icons as per
Alex's icon theming spec on freedesktop.org.

However, this module doesn't install a 'default' theme, which these ones inherit from.  The quickest way to do this:

1. Create a ~/.icons/default directory

2. Copy one of the <themename>/icons/index.theme files from this module into the directory, remove the "Inherits" line, and change the name line to "Name=default".

2. Switching icon themes
------------------------
Unless you're running my patched theme switcher dialog, you'll need to switch icon themes by hand using GConf:

$ gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/interface/icon_theme "<themename>" --type=string


3. To create low contrast icons in GIMP from the original coloured icon
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'll shortly be uploading a GIMP script so you can convert a whole bunch at a time (thanks Rodrigo!), but in the meantime, the process is:

- Load icon file
- Open Image->Colors->Levels dialog
- Set "modify levels for channel" to "value"
- Set output levels to 125 and 175
- Save icon :)
