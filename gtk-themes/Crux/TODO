****

 - use gdk_draw_points instead of multiple calls to gdk_draw_point

 - spinbutton arrows (5464)

 - paned widget thumbs (5466)

 - ACTIVE state of scrollbar thumbs

   This doesn't seem to be doable. By the time draw_box is called to
   draw the slider there's nothing set in the GtkRange widget showing
   whether or not the button is pressed

 - move `scaled' and `setbg' parameters of paint_stock_image to gtkrc

 - fix focused state of notebook tabs (5471?)

 - write formal grammar of engine data somewhere

 - 2d scroller in ggv looks horrible
