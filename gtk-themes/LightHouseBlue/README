LighthouseBlue Theme Engine
===========================

Install
-------

Use ./configure --prefix=/usr to install the engine in the default
location. Then type make and make install to build and install
the engine.


Notebook patch
--------------

The engine includes a patch against stock gtk+ 2.0.6 (gtk+ 2.0.7
also works with a little offset). Apply this patch against your
stock gtk+ sources to get an offset at the beginning and the end
of a row of tabs on notebooks.

You can configure the amount of pixels of the offset in the gtkrc
file with the widget property GtkNotebook::tab_offset.

If you applied the patch you also have to set the property
has_notebook_patch in the gtkrc file to TRUE.


Bold labels
-----------

If you do not like the bold labels for tabs or frames you can
turn off this feature by either setting the property
make_tab_labels_bold or make_frame_labels_bold to FALSE in the
gtkrc file.


Enjoy.
