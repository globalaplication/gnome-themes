	* metacity-theme-1.xml: Removed the title_spacer stuff that
	was a relic from Atlanta and was just making an ugly vertical line at
	the right edge of the titlebar.. Looked just strange and didnt belong
	there.

	* I also made the button padding a bit larger so it generally looks
	better with a bit larger font sizes.

	* update theme format for metacity 2.4.0

	* support for "border" window type
	* draw a border at the top of the window even when maximised (it
	looked arse with a panel at the top, it would blend the window into
	the panel)
	* fixed missing bottom of the frame for shaded/focused windows
